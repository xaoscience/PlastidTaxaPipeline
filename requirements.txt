# Python dependencies for GAPMananas - 23S Plastid rRNA Amplicon Analysis
# Bioinformatics and data analysis packages

# Core scientific computing
numpy>=2.0
scipy>=1.13
pandas>=2.1

# Visualization
matplotlib>=3.8
seaborn>=0.13
plotly>=5.17

# Jupyter environment
jupyter>=1.0
notebook>=7.0
ipython>=8.12

# R integration

# NOTE: rpy2 requires a working R installation to build. We install rpy2 inside
# the devcontainer (post-create) where R is available. Keep rpy2 out of the
# top-level requirements so CI dependency resolution doesn't need R.

# Bioinformatics
biopython>=1.84

# Machine learning (optional, for future analyses)
scikit-learn>=1.4
