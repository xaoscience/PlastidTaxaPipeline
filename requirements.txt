# Python dependencies for GAPMananas - 23S Plastid rRNA Amplicon Analysis
# Bioinformatics and data analysis packages

# Core scientific computing
numpy
scipy
pandas

# Visualization
matplotlib
seaborn
plotly

# Jupyter environment
jupyter
notebook
ipython

# R integration

# NOTE: rpy2 requires a working R installation to build. We install rpy2 inside
# the devcontainer (post-create) where R is available. Keep rpy2 out of the
# top-level requirements so CI dependency resolution doesn't need R.

# Bioinformatics
biopython

# Machine learning (optional, for future analyses)
scikit-learn
