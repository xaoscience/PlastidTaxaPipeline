# Python dependencies for GAPMananas - 23S Plastid rRNA Amplicon Analysis
# Bioinformatics and data analysis packages

# Core scientific computing
numpy>=1.24.0
scipy>=1.10.0
pandas>=2.0.0

# Visualization
matplotlib>=3.7.0
seaborn>=0.12.0
plotly>=5.14.0

# Jupyter environment
jupyter>=1.0.0
notebook>=7.0.0
ipython>=8.12.0

# R integration

# NOTE: rpy2 requires a working R installation to build. We install rpy2 inside
# the devcontainer (post-create) where R is available. Keep rpy2 out of the
# top-level requirements so CI dependency resolution doesn't need R.

# Bioinformatics
biopython>=1.81

# Machine learning (optional, for future analyses)
scikit-learn>=1.3.0
